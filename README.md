# A deep learning platform to reach new audiences and promote active engagement in the arts.

## How It Works:
First, our team of educators and technologists build **custom learning modules** around your music/art/culture.

Then, your new content is posted in the Project Playgrounds **web platform** for the world to enjoy. It is also embeddable for you to post on your website and share directly to your audience.

Finally, you receive **real-time analytics** visualizing how people around the world experience your content.

## Who Project Playgrounds Is For:
**Parents** and **Teachers** exposing their children to the great works of art.

**Locals** and **Tourists** exploring the cultural histories of the cities they are in.

[Maybe a picture of people in a city.]

**Anyone** who has ever had a question about or desire to dive deeper in a work of art.
